Hi everyone,<br>
 I can write about [Open Container Ecosystem](https://www.mindmeister.com/389671722/open-container-ecosystem-formerly-docker-ecosystem), today.

If you look at [mindmap](https://www.mindmeister.com/389671722/open-container-ecosystem-formerly-docker-ecosystem) created by [Krishnan Subramanian](http://krishworld.com/). You can see how is open container ecosystem wide.

You have in mindmap big categories:

- Container OS
- Application Deployment/Development platforms
- Developer tools
- Hosting/Service providers
- Database/Big data
- Config Management Tools with Docker support
- Networking
- Image registry
- Monitoring
- Security
- Scheduler/Orchestration/Management/Monitoring
- Misc

Some of them are cool and I make some posts about them, some can be split into more categories.

Next, I will write about how install docker and start our first container.

Regards,<br>
Ladislav
