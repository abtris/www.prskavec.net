Hi everyone,<br>
I see docker as two things. First is Docker platform created by [Docker, Inc](http://www.docker.com) that includes [Docker client/server](https://github.com/docker/docker), [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/) and docker tools (machine, swarm, compose). I make post about every tool.

Second is [The Open Container Initiative](https://www.opencontainers.org/) about [definition](https://github.com/opencontainers/specs) what is container and [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc) as first implementation. Docker made this with others companies and this is big.

Open Container ecosystem is huge and you see them in next post.

See you tomorrow,<br>
Ladislav
