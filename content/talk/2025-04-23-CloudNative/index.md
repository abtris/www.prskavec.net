title: From Small Terraform Projects to Terralith
event:  Cloud Native Prague 22
event_url: https://community.cncf.io/events/details/cncf-cloud-native-prague-presents-cloud-native-prague-22/
location: Prague, Czech Republic
summary: "In this talk, I'll walk you through the common evolution of Terraform projects - from simple beginnings to complex, sprawling infrastructure definitions that become increasingly difficult to manage. We'll explore the familiar challenges many teams face: starting with a handful of resources that gradually expand into an unwieldy codebase as business requirements grow. I'll share our team's journey transitioning from this state to Terralith, creating a more scalable and modular infrastructure solution."
