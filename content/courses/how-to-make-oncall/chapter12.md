Design on-call is a very hard process that constantly changes conditions. Number of people in teams is changing quite often, and you can add more people during hiring and remove people from the team and that isn’t easy. We don’t discuss handover time for sites and what is recommended.

If you choose Wednesday as an SRE book, recommend changing to weekly shift or Sunday or Monday. We use Sunday for reporting purposes, and we have an incident review on Monday, but I don’t see this as a problem.

There are time zones that make you think about different time for handover. We had 2 sites with California (9am PST) and Central Europe (6pm UTC+1) was a good time for us. But some combinations can’t work as well. For example Europe and India, the time zone difference is too small. It’s good for cooperation but not good for oncall. Sometimes it is good to don’t tie development teams to oncall teams.

Good luck with designing your fist on-call!
