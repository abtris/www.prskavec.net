There are many tools on the market ([PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/), [OpsGenie](https://www.atlassian.com/software/opsgenie), [VictorOps (Splunk On Call)](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/software/splunk-on-call.html), [ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com/) and more).

I have many years experience with PagerDuty and I can recommend using that. Iâ€™m sure that differences are very small, and you can use what fits your ecosystem.

There are links to documentation how scheduling can look like in OpsGenie and PagerDuty:

- https://docs.opsgenie.com/docs/on-call-schedules-and-rotations
- https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/schedules

If you have choice look for these things into tool:

- easy change for people on oncall (oncall market)
- schedule versioning - easy undo changes if make schedule changes
- support for calendar export
- mobile app is useful
- easy way how whitelisting phone numbers for calling to engineers
- support for voice call and sms, not all people using smartphones.
- support for Slack is great, and I will recommend, you can have bot that will answer who have oncall
- good API for your integrations
- the SDK for your favorite language is great!
- reporting is useful as we mention in the previous section.
