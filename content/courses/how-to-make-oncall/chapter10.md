We can split tools into multiple categories as pagers, incident response, utility and postmortems. More and more tools trying be more universal and covers more of it. Here is always what suits you best and how you can combine it.

There are many tools on the market, to pagers you can assign ([PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/), [OpsGenie](https://www.atlassian.com/software/opsgenie), [Splunk On Call - former VictorOps](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/software/splunk-on-call.html) and [Grafana OnCall](https://grafana.com/products/oncall/). For incident response you can use [Rootly](https://rootly.com/), [incident.io](https://incident.io/), [FireHydrant](https://firehydrant.com/) and others for example [Jeli Slack bot](https://www.jeli.io/slack-app). As utility I see [Backstage](https://backstage.io/), [Statuspage](https://www.atlassian.com/software/statuspage), [Status.io](https://status.io/). For postmortem is [Jeli](https://www.jeli.io/) but many others tools have some functions that can help with postmortem too. There plenty others that I don't know. Just during getting links for article I find [zenduty](https://www.zenduty.com/), [pagertree](https://pagertree.com/), many observability tools adding oncall functions as Grafana and [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/incident-response-with-datadog/).

I have many years experience with PagerDuty and I can recommend using that. Iâ€™m sure that differences are very small, and you can use what fits your ecosystem.

There are links to documentation how scheduling can look like in OpsGenie and PagerDuty:

- <https://docs.opsgenie.com/docs/on-call-schedules-and-rotations>
- <https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/schedules>

If you have choice look for these things into tool:

- easy change for people on oncall (oncall market)
- schedule versioning - easy undo changes if make schedule changes
- support for calendar export
- mobile app is useful
- easy way how whitelisting phone numbers for calling to engineers
- support for voice call and sms, not all people using smartphones.
- support for Slack is great, and I will recommend, you can have bot that will answer who have oncall
- good API for your integrations
- the SDK for your favorite language is great!
- reporting is useful as we mention in the previous section.
