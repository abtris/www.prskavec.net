You need to consider a few things if you have primary and secondary.

- Will rotate the same people on both rosters?
- Give more junior people to primary and more experience to secondary?
- If people rotate on both rosters, what happens if both people donâ€™t know what to do?
- How do we make escalations if both levels fail? Do I need some manager on-call or not? Do I want to page all members of the team instead?
