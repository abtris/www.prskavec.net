If you have primary and secondary you need consider a few things

  - Will rotate the same people on both?
  - Give more junior people to primary and more experience to secondary
  - If people rotating on both what happened that both people doesnâ€™t know what to do
  - How make escalations if both levels failed, do I need some tenary on-call or not
