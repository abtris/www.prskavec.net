If you have primary and secondary you need to consider a few things

- Will rotate the same people on both rosters?
- Give more junior people to primary and more experience to secondary?
- If people do rotate on both rosters what happened that both people donâ€™t know what to do?
- How make escalations if both levels failed, do I need some ternary on-call or not?
