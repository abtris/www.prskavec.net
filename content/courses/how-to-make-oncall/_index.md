## Guide to good On-call that does not kill your team

### How Many People Do You Need For On-call?

> "Using the 25% on-call rule, we can derive the minimum number of SREs required to sustain a 24/7 on-call rotation. Assuming that there are always two people on-call (primary and secondary, with different duties), the minimum number of engineers needed for on-call duty from a single-site team is eight: assuming week-long shifts, each engineer is on-call (primary or secondary) for one week every month. For dual-site teams, a reasonable minimum size of each team is six, both to honor the 25% rule and to ensure a substantial and critical mass of engineers for the team." - SRE book [^srebook]

As explained in the quote above, Google  recommends a minimum of 8 engineers for one site and 6 engineers per site in case of two sites. My own calculations show that you could have fewer engineers on-call if they are divided between two or three locations,  but you have to alway keep in mind vacations, sick days, business travels, etc.

I remember making a full on-call rotation with 6 people working 24/7/365 â€” it was exhausting with a significant impact on people's personal lives. As an SRE manager I always try to focus on achieving good work & time off balance for people being a part of an on-call rotation. The burden of providing non-stop support can be a major reason why people leave engineering teams.
