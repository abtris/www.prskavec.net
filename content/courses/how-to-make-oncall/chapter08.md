Reasons for creating an on-call market process:

It would be best to have an easy way to change shifts for vacation or when people need a free day. People can change days, hours, or whole shifts as they need it.

Please make the change 1:1 so that someone doesn't change shifts for money or skip engineering work. We use a Slack channel dedicated to this, and you need tools where making this change is easy and safe to do.

We have automated checking for the next two weeks if people haven't overlapped with primary and secondary. That is useful, too, if you have mixed shifts or you have more rosters.
