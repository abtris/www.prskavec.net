What I will recommend is an easy way to change shifts for vacation or just that people need a free day. People can change days, hours or whole shifts as they need it. Please just make change 1:1 so that someone doesn't change shifts for money or skipping engineering work. We use a Slack channel dedicated to this, and you need tools where making this change is easy and safe to do. We have automated checking for the next two weeks if people don't overlap with primary and secondary, that is useful too if you have mixed shifts, or you have more rosters.
