I will recommend that OnCall owners prepare a few reports that were useful for me during the years.

- How many incidents per week have per team. Using regularly for review every week.
- How many people have incidents in a month, quarter, 6 months.
- How many people have had incidents at night last month, quarter, 6 months.
- How many hours people have in oncall in last 6 months

Other reports are used for getting outliers. You can find if something doesnâ€™t work or goes in the wrong direction. At the start you can have too many incidents, after years you can have the opposite problem of having too few incidents. You can have people that don't have incidents for the whole year. In that case you need to invest more into gaming days and training.
