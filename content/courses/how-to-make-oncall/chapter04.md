My example is about weekly shifts but that isn’t that I prefer weekly shifts. I don’t think that weekly shifts are better or worse. I think that if you are 1 site team, daily shifts are better. You can work weekends extra and make 6 people deal with the whole week. For 2-3 sites, weekly shifts are more common. Strategy named “follow the sun” is usually defined by omitting the night shift from oncall that can be done in 2 or 3 sites. You have many handovers and this is something that you have to prepare carefully.
