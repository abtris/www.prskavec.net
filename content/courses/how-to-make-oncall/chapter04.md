My example is about weekly shifts but that isn’t that I prefer weekly shifts. I don’t think that weekly shifts are better or worse. I think that if you are 1 site team, daily shifts are better. You can work weekends extra and make 6 people deal with the whole week. For 2-3 sites, weekly shifts are more common. Strategy named "follow the sun" (FTS [^1]) is usually defined by omitting the night shift from oncall that can be done in 2 or 3 sites. You have many handovers and this is something that you have to prepare carefully.

I think from my experience daily on-call is better for work time life balance. You don't have whole week with computer and you can easily move your program to evening movie or theater if is just one day, you switch shift with colleague more easily.

You can make some custom scheme that fits to you, but simplicity is key here too. For more complex tiers you need tooling that checks if the same person doesn't have primary and secondary together. That looks obvious but I seen many times people that happens and it's not good for that person. My friend exactly mention that this happened on first shift new member of on-call his team on his first shift and was it over weekend. Others find it on Monday.
