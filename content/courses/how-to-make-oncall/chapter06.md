Primary and secondary layer are for resolve and manage incidents.

You need escalation process for a few reasons

- interchangeability for any reasons (primary have problem access internet, traveling, oversleep etc.)
- nobody responses on primary/secondary and you need address this (manager on-call)
- problems that can't be resolved by primary/secondary (security, legal, executive decision need it)

It's always good test it all escalations, specially with executives who aren't really paged often. Is always good if all stakeholders have enough information about current incidents and don't step in process and ask Incident commander for information.
